The irresponsible clojure guild presents...

# utrecht

Just enough rope to wrangle a jdbc.

A modern, minimalist database library with an emphasis on correctness,
stability and performance. We provide a connection pool and a small
library that make it easy to work with Postgres.

## Features

* HikariCP database pool
* Simple api
* Support for transactions (all isolations) and prepared queries
* Optional 'component' interface

## Usage

This module requires JDK 8. Please upgrade to JDK 8 to improve
the security and performance of your applications.

```clojure
(ns my.db
 (:require [irresponsible.utrecht :as u])
 (:import  [clojure.lang ExceptionInfo]))

(def pool (u/make-pool hikari-pool-opts))
(def bars (u/with-conn [conn pool]
            (u/with-prep [q "select * from foo where bar = ?"]
              (u/query conn q ["bar"]))) ; query can also take a sql string
(def quuxs (try ; with-transaction binds a connection like with-conn
              (u/with-transaction :ro :serializable [conn pool]
                (u/savepoint conn :sp1) ; savepoints!
                (let [r (u/query conn "select 'foo' as result")]
                  (u/rollback :sp1) ; rolling back to savepoints!
                  (throw (ex-info "throw to rollback the entire transaction" {:result r}))))
              (catch ExceptionInfo e ; yes, your exception is rethrown
                (:result (ex-data e)))))

;; During shutdown you'll want to close the pool
(.close pool)
```

## Recommendations

We highly recommend using this module in conjunction with a recent
postgres and [mpg](https://github.com/mpg-project/mpg) which
provides transparent conversion between pg and clojure data types.

## Hacking

### Running Tests

Testing requires a configured **PostgreSQL** database to perform tests against,
and requires expressing that configuration by use of *environment variables*.

Very basic usage is as simple as

```shell
UTRECHT_TEST_DB="utrecht_test" boot test
```

Which will execute tests against an assumed **PostgreSQL** server running locally on the default ports
without any specific authentication requirements.

If these defaults are not to your liking, the following *environment variables* are settable:

```shell
UTRECHT_TEST_HOST="127.0.0.1"
UTRECHT_TEST_CONN_TIMEOUT="5000" # milliseconds
UTRECHT_TEST_USER=""
UTRECHT_TEST_PASS=""
UTRECHT_TEST_PORT="5432"
```
